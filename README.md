## Abstract:
This project presents a lung cancer detection system using machine learning techniques. The system utilizes computed tomography (CT) scans to train a model that can accurately detect lung cancer. Image processing and feature extraction techniques are employed to enhance image quality and extract relevant features. The performance of various machine learning models, including support vector machines (SVMs), random forests, and neural networks, is evaluated. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in detecting lung cancer at an early stage.
